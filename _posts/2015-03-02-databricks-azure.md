title: "Adding widget in pyspark notebook"


let say you some data to know the order status of a order which has dates, order id etc.,


Order table

Here I have used dropdown widget which has orderstatus as widget name with defaultvalue closed and choices to select

with the above way, orders_status will dymanically show data from format(os)

finally when you select the filter in the widget, it changes dynamically
